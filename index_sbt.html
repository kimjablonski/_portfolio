        <h1>Blue Devils Softball</h1>

         Collage and photo manipulations were among the first things
           <br>The Blue Devil Softball shirt was one that I created for my softball team at UW-Stout. We were going on our annual spring break trip where we would play 12 games. The goal of the shirt was to create a design that followed Stouts athletic branding guidelines but was specific to the trip. I created the design, pitched it to our coaches and got it approved by the department. It was a good experience to create a design that the team, coaches, family and friends all wore.
